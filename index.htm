    <h1>Privacy Policy for "I Need - All in One"</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: July 10, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to "I Need - All in One". This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our application. Your privacy is important to us.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Our application, "I Need - All in One," is designed as a web portal or a collection of links to various third-party websites and services. We <strong>do not</strong> directly collect any personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only data stored on your device by our app is related to your preferences, such as your chosen theme (light/dark mode) and color scheme. This information is stored locally on your device using your browser's local storage and is not transmitted to us.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>
      Our app contains links to many other websites (e.g., Facebook, Amazon, YouTube, etc.). When you click on a link and visit a third-party website, you are leaving our application. These external sites have their own separate and independent privacy policies. We, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the content, activities, and privacy practices of these linked sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website you visit.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Advertising (Adsterra)</h2>
    <p>
      We use a third-party advertising company, Adsterra, to serve ads when you use our application. The script for Adsterra is included in our app. Adsterra may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This may include collecting data through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, such as your IP address, device identifiers, and browsing behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on how Adsterra collects and uses data, please review their privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Log Data & Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Our app itself does not use cookies for tracking. However, the third-party services we link to, including our advertising partner (Adsterra), may use cookies. Cookies are small files stored on your device that help websites and ad networks remember your preferences and show relevant content and ads. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since we do not collect personal data, we comply by design. However, any third-party services (like ads) may track behavior as per their policies. You can manage your consent preferences via your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>CCPA Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have the right to know what personal information is collected, request deletion, and opt-out of sale of personal information. Our app does not collect or sell any personal information. For Adsterraâ€™s data use, please refer to their privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
